		This installation consists of 150 tons of rebar salvaged from 
		cites of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake in China. Each piece of 
		rebar was manually straightened. AiWeiWei wanted to use 
		this installation to emphasize the Country&#39;s 
		responsibility for this tragedy that was created by the economic 
		boom.
